Good evening to you all. This is a wonderful day for me, although the actual graduation happened months ago,
and I feel very proud to be here with each and every one of you. 
Thank you for honoring this simple party, and I hope you have a great time.

When my dad told me he was planning this party, I felt so much pressure about what I’d actually say. 
I had a couple of speeches drafted, but some of them were too long, 
others did not feel complete. So I decided I’ll make a speech to thank my family. 

As I celebrate this achievement, the biggest reward to me is having my family with me today. 
I have always wanted to make my parents proud, starting from High School. 
They were both very happy for me. It is unfortunate that my mom isn’t here to celebrate this achievement with me. 
I bet she’s proud of me up there with the angels. 
So, thank you dad for the sacrifices you had to make in order to get me through school. 

Thank you for all of the love you’ve given me throughout my life. Thank you for being wonderful people. 
All of my friends who’ve had the chance to meet you say that you’re the coolest people that they’ve ever met. 
And they are definitely right. I hope this bachelor’s degree makes you proud of me, 
and I hope it makes you as happy as I am. I am thrilled to say that I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science!!

Thank you!
